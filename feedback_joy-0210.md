            so that displays frequence table matches the input when the input table is changed
        File for list manipulation: 
          1.add code to calculate the average exin lengh and print the list

           counts_array = np.array(exon_counts)
           average=lengths_array/counts_array
           sort=sorted(average)
           print ("the average lengths are:" + str(average))"
