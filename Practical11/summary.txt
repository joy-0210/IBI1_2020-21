the percentage of identical amino acid:
between human and mouse is 89.63963963963964%
between human adn random seq is 5.405405405405405%
between mouse and random seq is 5.8558558558558556%

conclusion
The bigger alignmment score is, the more similar the two sequences are.
The alignment score between both human and random seq, mouse and random seq are -250. And the percentage of identical amino acid between both human and random seq, mouse and random seq are smaller than 6%. These basically rules out experimental chance. 
The alignment score and the identical percentage between human and mouse are very high, which shows human and mouse are closely relevant.
According to the theory of origin of species, it is likely that the SOD2 is a highly conserved sequence and SOD2 proteins are similar in mammals.
